## 4.4.5 Static

All fields are member fields unless the modifier `static` is used. Static fields are used "on the class" whereas non-static fields are used "on a class instance":

[include](assets/StaticField.hx)

Static [variable](class-field-variable.md) and [property](class-field-property.md) fields can have arbitrary initialization [expressions](expression.md).
