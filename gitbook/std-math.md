## 10.4 Math

Haxe includes a floating point math library for some common mathematical operations. Most of the functions operate on and return `floats`. However, an `Int` can be used where a `Float` is expected, and Haxe also converts `Int` to `Float` during most numeric operations  (see [Numeric Operators](types-numeric-operators.md) for more details).

Here are some example uses of the math library:
